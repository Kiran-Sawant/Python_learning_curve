The objects pickled in the pickle file must be unpickled in the
same order as they were pickled. ie. they must be loaded in the
same order as they were dumped.

not all objects can be pickled

new pickling protocalls are not backward compatable, ie. if you
pickled an object in a pickle file using protocol=1 and try to load
the pickle using protocol=4 it will not load, python3 uses protocol
3 by default.

only unpickle the data that you can trust, that you have got from
a trusted site, pickle files can be unsecure
