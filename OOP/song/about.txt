    This Project segrigates information about a song into different related lists.

    It reads albums.txt in which each line represents info of a song.
The program consists of a load_data() function that returns a list of Artist objects,
each Artist object contains a list of Album objects for that perticular artist.
Album objects contain a list of Song objects of that Album.

    When we execute the load_data() function it creates a Artist object and appends it to
its own list. Then it uses the .add_song() method defined in the Artist class and passes
the album_field as well to search for that album in album_list in Artist class, if not found
Artist class creates an Album object and appends it to its Album list, then it uses the
.add_track() method defiened in the Album class to search for song, creates and adds it if not found.
    The load_data() moves to the next line in txt file and repeats the process, this time if the
fields are already found in the lists, skips creating the objects, appends them to the list and
executes the secondary process(add_song, add_track).

The seaching if achieved through a find_object() function.
